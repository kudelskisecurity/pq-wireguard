# PQ-WireGuard

In this branch, we integrate our [tweaked implementation of the crystals post-quantum algorithms](https://github.com/kudelskisecurity/crystals-go/tree/tweakedKyber) in the [Go implementation of Wireguard](https://github.com/WireGuard/wireguard-go) following the [Fujioka contruction](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-30057-8_28).
Please refer to [our blog-post](https://wordpress.com/post/research.kudelskisecurity.com/15437) for more information.

## WIP

We are currently working on overriding the [`wg(8)` commands](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/about/src/man/wg.8) to allow the users to input Kyber keys.
For now, the key pair and the peers' key must be given within a configuration file when starting the interface, using the `-c` or `--config_file` flag followed by the .conf file. We included examples of such file (see [peer0.conf](https://github.com/kudelskisecurity/pq-wireguard/blob/tweakedKyber/peer0.conf)) to showcase the accepted format and required fields.

## Building

This requires an installation of [go](https://golang.org) â‰¥ 1.13.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kudelskisecurity/pq-wireguard
$ cd pq-wireguard
$ go build
```

## Usage

Most Linux kernel WireGuard users are used to adding an interface with `ip link add wg0 type wireguard`. With wireguard-go, instead simply run:

```
$ ./wireguard -c peerX.conf wg0
```

This will create an interface and fork into the background. To remove the interface, use the usual `ip link del wg0`, or if your system does not support removing interfaces directly, you may instead remove the control socket via `rm -f /var/run/wireguard/wg0.sock`, which will result in wireguard-go shutting down.

To run wireguard-go without forking to the background, pass `-f` or `--foreground`:

```
$ ./wireguard -f -c peerX.conf wg0
```

When an interface is running, you may use the usual `ip(8)` and `ifconfig(8)` commands `ip addr add X.X.X.X/X dev wg0` and `ip link set wg0 up`.
See the original wireguard-go [README](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-go/REAMDE.md) for more details

To run with more logging you may set the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL=debug`.

## Generating the .conf file

The public and private keys can be generated and printed using the `--keygen` flag.
```
$ ./wireguard --keygen
```

The IP address to use as endpoint can be extracted using the `ip addr` command.
The port to be used can be randomly assigned among the free ports.
The protocol version is set to 1, the booleans `replace_allowed_ips` and `replace_peers` are set to true.

## Demo

You can watch below the video of two peers being configured side-by-side.
